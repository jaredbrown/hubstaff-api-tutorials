# Consuming Hubstaff API In Rails Web Application

![Tutorial Homepage](/images/homepage.png)

This tutorial will go over how to integrate the `hubstaff-ruby` gem into your Rails application. The `hubstaff-ruby` gem allows you to easily link a user to their Hubstaff account and retrieve useful information such as custom team reports, project and activity details, screenshots, and much more.

The [Hubstaff Rails App
repository](https://github.com/hookengine/hubstaff-sample-apps/tree/master/rails-sample-app) contains the complete application you'll have after this tutorial.

First, this tutorial will go over linking a User to their
Hubstaff account and then show how to retrieve data.

You'll retrieve two core resources provided by the Hubstaff API, custom team reports and screenshots.

Before you begin, you need to set up a [Hubstaff
account](https://hubstaff.com/). I also recommend creating some data so that
your application will be able to view data, specifically create a organization,
project, notes, and a few screenshots.

After you've created some data, you need to go to the [Hubstaff developer
page](https://developer.hubstaff.com/), click My Apps and create a new
application. You’re ready to dive in once you create an application and receive your `App-Token`.

Download the sample application and open it application in your editor of choice.

First you will open up your Gemfile and add the `hubstaff-ruby` gem and `dotenv`
gem, then run `bundle install`.

```ruby
gem 'hubstaff-ruby', '~> 0.0.1'
gem 'dotenv', '~> 2.1'
```
For this tutorial you might not push anything up publicly, but that may change
in the future. So, I'd recommend opening up your `.gitignore` file and include
`.env.local`.

You can then create this file in your root directory and place in the following
code, swapping in your specific `App-Token`:

```ruby
APP_TOKEN=“<App Token Hubstaff Provided>”
```
Now open up your `environment.rb` file where you will require hubstaff and load
your `.env.local` file:

```ruby
# Load the Rails application.
require File.expand_path('../application', __FILE__)
require 'hubstaff'
Dotenv.load(".env.local")

# Initialize the Rails application.
Rails.application.initialize!
```
## Connecting Your Users To Their Hubstaff Account

Now that you have your hubstaff gem setup you can begin incorporating it into your
User class. Let’s open up your `user.rb` file and include the following lines:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Hubstaff
  serialize :client
  has_secure_password
  validates :email, :presence => true
end
```
Next you will need to create a new migration for the users table to get the
`:client` attribute working. In your terminal enter:
`rails generate migration AddClientToUsers client:text`.

For the serialize method to work correctly you will need to make client a text
data type. This will create the following migration table:

```ruby
class AddClientToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :users, :client, :text
  end
end
```
Once you have your migration setup, you can run `rake db:migrate` to migrate the
database.

Now that your User class has access to a client attribute you can link the logged
in user to their Hubstaff account.

First let’s reorganize the `application.html.erb` file to include a button that
will link to your Hubstaff log in form. Change the nav block to the following

```erb
  <nav class="navbar navbar-default">
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="navbar-header">
        <% if current_user %>
          <%= link_to "Hubstaff Gem Tutorial", user_path(current_user), class: "navbar-brand" %>
        <% else %>
          <%= link_to "Hubstaff Gem Tutorial", root_path, class: "navbar-brand" %>
        <% end %>
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
          <% if current_user %>
            <li><%= link_to "Log Out", logout_path %></li>
          <% else %>
            <li><%= link_to "Sign Up", signup_path %></li>
            <li><%= link_to "Sign In", login_path%></li>
          <% end %>
          <% if current_user && current_user.client.nil? %>
            <button class="btn btn-success navbar-btn"><%= link_to "Connect to Hubstaff", client_path("#{current_user.id}") %></button>
            <% end %>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
```
You'll also need to add two routes; a get route to point to the log in form and
a post route to post the log in data to Hubstaff

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root "welcome#index"

  get 'signup', to: 'users#new', as: 'signup'
  get 'login', to: 'sessions#new', as: 'login'
  get 'logout', to: 'sessions#destroy', as: 'logout'

  get 'users/:id/hubstaff', to: 'users#client', as: 'client'
  post '/auth_client', to: 'users#auth_client'

  resources :users
  resources :sessions
end
```
Next you will build out your log in form. Create a file called `client.html.erb` and add the following form:

```erb
<%= form_tag(controller: "users", action: "auth_client", method: "post") do %>
  <%= label_tag :email %>
  <%= text_field_tag :hubstaff_email %>
  <%= label_tag :password %>
  <%= password_field_tag :hubstaff_password %>
  <%= submit_tag "Log into Hubstaff" %>
<% end %>
```
Now that you have your routes and form ready, let’s open up your
`users_controller.rb` file and add your `#client` and `#auth_client` action.
Add the following code to your UsersController:

```ruby

def client
end

def auth_client
  user = current_user
  if params[:hubstaff_email].present? && params[:hubstaff_password].present?
    client = Hubstaff::Client.new(params[:hubstaff_email], params[:hubstaff_password])
      if client.nil?
        redirect_to user_path(user), alert: "Unable to Connect to Hubstaff"
      else
        user.client = client
        user.save
        redirect_to user_path(user), notice: "Connected to Hubstaff"
      end
  else
    redirect_to user_path(user), alert: "Unable to Connect to Hubstaff"
  end
end
```
The `#auth_client` method validates that the form params are present and then
assigns a new instance of the Hubstaff::Client class to the client variable.

If the form was not fully filled in or the log in was unsuccessful the client
will return nil and you redirect the user with a flash message.

Otherwise the user’s client attribute is assigned to the client variable which
stores the instance of Hubstaff::Client, saves the user and redirects with a
success message

Now the user is fully linked to their Hubstaff account and won’t need to log in
again when they use the application!

Now that the user is linked to their Hubstaff account you can use forms to
retrieve specific information. As I mentioned in the introduction, this tutorial
will go over retrieving custom team report data and screenshots

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/hookengine/hubstaff-ruby) if
you would like to learn about additional methods provided by the Hubstaff gem.
Lets get started

First you will add the appropriate post routes to handle your form data. Here is
what the final routes file should look like

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root "welcome#index"

  get 'signup', to: 'users#new', as: 'signup'
  get 'login', to: 'sessions#new', as: 'login'
  get 'logout', to: 'sessions#destroy', as: 'logout'

  get 'users/:id/hubstaff', to: 'users#client', as: 'client'
  post '/auth_client', to: 'users#auth_client'
  post '/custom_report', to: 'users#get_custom_report'
  post '/screenshots', to: 'users#get_screenshots'

  resources :users
  resources :sessions
end
```
Next in your `show.html.erb` file you will build your buttons and forms using
Bootstrap modals. Here is what the revised show file will look like

```erb
<h1>Welcome <%= @user.email %></h1>

<% if @user.client %>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#reportModal">
    Create a custom Hubstaff team report
  </button>

  <!-- Custom Report Modal -->

          <% end %>

            <%= submit_tag "Retrieve Screenshots" %>
          <% end %>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## Retrieving Custom Reports From Hubstaff

Finally you have to write the methods to retrieve the custom report data and screenshots. Let’s begin with the `#get_custom_report` method.

```ruby
  def get_custom_report
    user = current_user
    options = {}
    options[:orgs] = params[:orgs] unless params[:orgs] == ""
    options[:projects] = params[:projects] unless params[:projects] == ""
    options[:users] = params[:users] unless params[:users] = ""
    options[:show_tasks] = params[:show_tasks]
    options[:show_notes] = params[:show_notes]
    options[:show_activity] = params[:show_activity]
    options[:include_archieved] = params[:include_archieved]
    @report = user.client.custom_date_team(params[:start_date], params[:end_date], options)
  end
```

Before calling the Hubstaff gem method `#custom_data_team` you need to build your
options hash with the params provided by the form

You also need to add some validations so that you don’t pass an empty string as a
value.

It’s important to use the proper key names for using all the Hubstaff methods
that take a options hash correctly, please reference the
[documentation](https://github.com/hookengine/hubstaff-ruby) to confirm the
proper key names needed for each method

With the options hash built, you'll simply pass it as the third argument and
assign the returned JSON to @report.  As a side note, all Hubstaff methods will
return JSON data

Now it’s only a matter of extracting the JSON to display nicely on your view
page. Create a file called `get_custom_report.html.erb` and place the following
code in it

```erb
<% @report["organizations"].each do |org| %>
  <h1>Organization Name: <%= org["name"] %></h1>
  <% org["dates"].each do |date| %>
    <h2>Date: <%= date["date"] %></h2>
    <% date["users"].each do |user| %>
      <h3>User: <%= user["name"] %></h3>
        <% user["projects"].each do |project| %>
          <h1>Project: <%= project["name"] %></h1>
        <% end %>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```
Awesome, now you can retrieve a custom team report from your Hubstaff account!

## Retrieving Screenshots From Hubstaff

Next let's create a method to retrieve screenshots. Back in your
`users_controller.rb` file add the following method:

```ruby
def get_screenshots
  user = current_user
  options = {}
  options[:orgs] = params[:orgs] unless params[:orgs] == ""
  options[:projects] = params[:projects] unless params[:projects] == ""
  options[:users] = params[:users] unless params[:users] == ""
  options[:offset] = params[:offset]
  @screenshots = user.client.screenshots(params[:start_time], params[:stop_time], options)
end
```
This method is very similar to your `#get_custom_report` method, where you build a options hash based on the form params and pass that hash as the third argument to your `#screenshots` method

Now all that is left to do is display each screenshot. As I mentioned before all methods provided by the Hubstaff gem return JSON.

Specifically, the `#screenshots` JSON output contains a url key with a value
equal to the screenshot url. Let's extract the url address and display the each
image on your view page

Create a file called `get_screenshots.html.erb` and add the following code:

```ruby
<% @screenshots["screenshots"].each do |screen| %>
  <%= image_tag "#{screen['url']}" %><br><br><br>
<% end %>
```

Now when you submit the form you should be redirected to a page displaying all
the screenshots that fit within the given form parameters.

The `hubstaff-ruby` gem allows your Rails application to retrieve
useful information from the Hubstaff app, making it easy for your customers access to their Hubstaff data within your application.
